# Powers

## Description
This is a program I made a couple years ago that calculates the exponentials of the number entered n number of times.

## Compilation
**make**

## Execution
**bin/powers base exponent print**
*base* - integer value
*exponent* - integer value
*print* - boolean (0, 1) on whether to print the output to a file or not
