# Powers

## Description
This is a program I made a few years ago that calculates the exponentials of the number entered n number of times.
This program is able to calculate extremely large numbers. This is due to the fact that it uses a *Number* struct to 
keep track of each individual digit in the power, and thus is not limited to the normal bounds of basic numeral data
types (integer, long, float, double, etc).

## Compilation
**make**

## Execution
**bin/powers base exponent print**

*base* - integer value

*exponent* - integer value

*print* - boolean (0, 1) on whether to print the output to a file or not
